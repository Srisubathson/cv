    <h3>My hobbies</h3>
   <h4>
    Watching Movies and TV Shows
   </h4>
   <p>
    Movie watching is one of my favorite pastimes. When I used to watch foreign-language movies, I would just utilize the subtitles if I didn't understand the language. 
    I have been watching movies on Netflix and Amazon Prime, and I prefer using a laptop over a mobile device for this. On certain times, I go to the theater to see a performance,
     for instance, in case my friends are also interested in the same performance that I'm going to. Furthermore, I much favor romantic and true-life tale movies because, in my opinion,
    they have a powerful effect on our minds. To sum up, watching movies is one of my favorite pastimes because it makes me happy and helps to rest my mind.

   <h4>
   Playing Cricket
   </h4>
   <p>
    I love playing cricket, which is also a well-known sport. 
    It makes me feel powerful, healthy, and fit. That gives me a sense of self-assurance and pride in 
    who I am. I first picked up a cricket bat when I was just 7 years old. 
    When I was a young child, I developed a fondness for the game of cricket and began playing it in the 
    backyard of my house with my older brother. 
    In compared to kids my age, I was also a good player at the time. Maybe it's because I enjoy playing cricket so 
    much and take every ball too seriously. I'm fan of Kumar sangakara and Ms Dhoni.
    Both of them are my idol.
